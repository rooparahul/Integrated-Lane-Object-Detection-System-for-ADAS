## Description
This project focuses on **Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, and Machine Learning Models** for ADAS test data. The objective is to enhance model accuracy by cleaning data, creating meaningful features, and applying multiple ML algorithms.

## Features
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature engineering from raw ADAS test logs
- Predictive modeling using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking Regressor
- Model evaluation using RMSE, RÂ², and cross-validation
- Comparison of multiple model performances
